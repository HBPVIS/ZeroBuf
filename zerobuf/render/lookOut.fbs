// This event is named "LookOut" instead of "Camera" because
// it may be used in immersive environments. The orientation of 
// a display surface or the head position of the observer should 
// not be part of this event, i.e., if the user is on a magic 
// carpet, you will synchronize the matrices describing the 
// carpets but not the user's local movements on the carpet.
// More scientifically can be said that, this transforms from 
// world space to carpet space.
//
// The LookOut event contains 16 doubles values representing a 
// matrix. The layout of this values is the one expected by OpenGL.
// The positions are in meters.
