ZeroBuf
=======

# Overview

ZeroBuf implements zero-copy, zero-serialize, zero-hassle protocol
buffers. It is a replacement for FlatBuffers, resolving the following
shortcomings:

* Direct get and set functionality on the defined data members
* A single memory buffer storing all data members, which is directly
  serializable
* Usable, random read and write access to the data members
* Zero copy of the data used by the (C++) implementation from and to the network

# Features

* Storage of (u)int[8,16,32,64,128]_t, float, double and enum single elements,
  static and dynamic sub-structures, fixed size and dynamic arrays of
  static-sized elements
* Access to arrays using raw pointers, iterators, std::array,
  std::string and std::vector
* Conversion to and from a JSON representation

# Extensions to flatbuffers grammar

* Arrays can have an optional fixed size specified as part of the type,
  e.g., ```matrix:[float:16]``` for a 16 value float array
* byte and ubyte data is base64 encoded in JSON, int8_t and uint8_t are
  represented as value arrays

# Building from Source

ZeroBuf is a cross-platform library, designed to run on any modern operating
system, including all Unix variants. It requires a C++11 compiler and uses CMake
to create a platform-specific build environment. The following platforms and
build environments are tested:

* Linux: Ubuntu 16.04, RHEL 6.8 (Makefile, Ninja)
* Mac OS X: 10.9 (Makefile, Ninja)

Building from source is as simple as:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/HBPVIS/ZeroBuf.git
    mkdir ZeroBuf/build
    cd ZeroBuf/build
    cmake -GNinja -DCLONE_SUBPROJECTS=ON ..
    ninja
